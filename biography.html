                        About Beth (Yes, That's Really My Name!)
                        You guys might be asking yourself, "Who in the world is Beth?" Well, let me clear that up—I'm Elizabeth Oviedo, and I simply took the last part of my name to create "Beth." Pretty clever, right? (Or maybe I just really like keeping things simple!)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now that we've solved that mystery, let me tell you about my journey from debugging code to discovering the art of copywriting—a path I never knew existed until recently.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Here's the thing about me: I'm not just a techy person hiding behind a computer screen. Sure, I have a degree in Computer Science and spent years as a software developer, but what really stood out throughout my career was something I didn't fully understand at the time—I had the power of persuasion.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It started in college. When my team and I built apps for class projects, I naturally became the one presenting to professors. I had this ability to explain why our app had incredible value in a way that made them lean forward and pay attention. We consistently received great grades, and I knew it was largely because of how I communicated our work.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This pattern continued when I entered the professional world as a software developer. My role quickly evolved beyond just writing code. I found myself presenting to executives, directors, and higher-ups in the companies where I worked. Whether I was writing technical documentation, crafting business proposals, or explaining complex applications to stakeholders, I had this knack for making people understand not just what we built, but why it mattered.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I fell in love with the power of words during those years. I discovered how the right combination of words could transform confusion into clarity, turn skepticism into enthusiasm, and make technical features feel like must-have solutions. Technical documentation became my secret passion—I was writing API guides and user manuals with the same precision I applied to clean code, but with something extra that made complex ideas approachable and engaging.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But here's the thing—I knew I had this power of persuasion, but I had absolutely no idea there was an entire career built around it. I had never heard anything about copywriting.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Then everything changed when I discovered Cardinal Mason's YouTube channel. As I watched his videos about copywriting, my entire world shifted. Everything suddenly clicked. I realized that what I'd been doing all those years—persuading stakeholders, crafting compelling presentations, finding the perfect words to bridge technical solutions with business needs—that was copywriting!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I knew I had to learn more. So I made the decision to take Cardinal Mason's course and learn the necessary skills of copywriting. It was incredible to finally put formal structure and strategy behind what I'd been doing intuitively for years.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What really drives me is the human connection. I've always been an avid reader with a natural talent for friendly persuasion—the kind that doesn't feel pushy but feels like helpful guidance from a friend. I wanted to step away from endless debugging sessions and start building bridges between businesses and their customers through strategic communication.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now I'm channeling all of these skills—my analytical thinking from my Computer Science background, my natural power of persuasion honed through years of presentations, my technical writing expertise, and my formal copywriting training from Cardinal Mason—into freelance copywriting.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I bring something unique to the table: the precision of a developer, the strategic thinking of someone who's navigated corporate environments, and the proven ability to make complex ideas compelling. But most importantly, I understand that words only have real power when there's genuine, unique value that stands out.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Whether you need website copy that converts, email campaigns that engage, or content that clearly explains your services while motivating readers to take action, I offer the perfect combination of natural talent, real-world experience, and professional copywriting training.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ready to discover what words can do for your business? Let's find the perfect combination that helps your customers see exactly why they need what you're offering.
